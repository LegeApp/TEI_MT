# TEI Viewer

Lightweight browser viewer for translated CBETA-style TEI XML.

## Features

- Open an entire folder (`Open Folder`) and browse a file index.
- Filter file index by filename/path.
- Side-by-side Original + Translation rendering.
- Toggle visibility of Original/Translation columns.

## Use

```bash
cd tei-viewer
./run_viewer.sh
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8765/`.

Then:
